CASE FILE: #404-OPSEC
MISSION: Recover the stolen exam data.

You have three evidence files:
- traffic.pcapng
- server_backup.tar
- secure.zip

PHASE 1 — NETWORK
Use network tools to identify the attacker’s custom exploit tool.
Look for unusual HTTP traffic. Most requests are noise.

PHASE 2 — SERVER
Search for sloppy admin artifacts and log entries.
Confirm your findings.

PHASE 3 — DECRYPT
The Phantom is arrogant.
The password for secure.zip is connected to their tool identity.

Good luck, Agent.
